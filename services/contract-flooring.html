      Carpet and carpet tiles      
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the most popular requested floor coverings, carpet is chosen by many of our commercial flooring clients throughout the UK for its hardwearing, versatile & cost effective nature.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why choose carpet flooring?
    </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Carpets can make a measurable contribution to retaining the warmth in commercial areas and therefore saving on energy bills. Carpets have low heat conduction and are natural thermal insulators, creating a heat barrier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Carpets have 'noise absorbing' properties, ideal for use in areas where noise pollution needs to be minimal i.e offices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safety - The soft resilient fibres of a carpet provide a cushioning effect and excellent orthopaedic properties. The non-slip and soft resilience of carpet, especially in the event of a fall, lowers the risk of injury.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cleaning and maintenance of carpet is quick, easy and low cost.
        </li>
      </ul>

      Commercial Stone Flooring
    </h2>
    <p>
      The natural, tactile and aesthetic qualities of natural stone create a beautiful backdrop to any commercial flooring project. Marble, Slate, Sandstone, Limestone and Porcelain are amongst the most popular, and the choice of colours and designs is more diverse than ever.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why choose stone for your commercial flooring needs?
    </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Stone is excellent at creating a focal point.        
        </li>
        <li>
          Adds a natural feel to any commercial spaces such as offices and retail space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stone is extremely durable - ideal for areas of heavy footfall in commercial environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Natural stone flooring offers a clean, hard-wearing and healthy flooring option, free from dust and dirt which can affect softer floor coverings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stone is a natural material that improves with age. It weathers with wear and tear which helps contribute to its character.        
        </li>
