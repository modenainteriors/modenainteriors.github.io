      Solid Surface Fabrication
    </h2>
    <p>
      Solid surface is one of the most versatile materials used for the interior furniture market. Its ability to be used in environments that span from wet and humid to hygiene conscious makes solid surface a popular choice for many architects and designers.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have been providing Solid Surfacing solutions for residential &amp; commercial environments including reception areas, kitchens, bathrooms, restaurants, dental surgeries, hospitals, washrooms, leisure &amp; sports facilities, veterinary operating theatres, marine applications, interior and exterior cladding and an extensive range of furniture for many British and international designers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solid Surfaces offer endless design potential and unrivalled product performance. Solid Surfaces can be cut, shaped, moulded, routed and thermoformed into 3D shapes. Any joints can be glued inconspicuously giving unlimited freedom for use in a variety of scenarios offering a great deal more flexibility than conventional granite solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can work with all the major solid surface manufacturers to ensure you get the exact decor you want. We have our own in-house design team and are able to offer you a complete Solid Surfacing design, templating and installation service.  We are Dupont Quality Network approved fabricators and installers.  Our workmanship and the Corian® product are covered by Duponts’ 10 year warranty giving you complete peace of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within our portfolio of Solid Surfaces we are proud to be a Quality Assured Dupont Corian Fabricator, Stragegic Partner of LG HI Macs and Approved Fabricator of Avonite, Velstone, Staron, Wilsonart, Durat and Hanex.
